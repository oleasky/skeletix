## TailwindCSS Integration with `barestyles`

`barebones` components work best when the `barestyles` TailwindCSS plugin is installed. If `barestyles` is not detected, components will render without `barestyles`-specific utility classes, and you may see a warning in the console.

### Installation
To use `barebones` with `barestyles`:
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install barestyles barebones
